# Q.1. (LIS) Identify FRs and NFRs:

<!-- **1. Functional Requirements:**   -->
### 1. Functional Requirements: <br><br>
- **user registration:**   
Any institute member who wants to use the library's services must register with the system for library resources. The member would receive a user ID and password after successfully registering. For any upcoming LIS transaction, he must use these credentials.  
- **User login:**  
An already registred user of LIS can login to the system by the user ID and password (that he got while registering). On successful login the Home page of the LIS is shown from where he can access the different functionalities of LIS: 
  - search book
  - issue book
  - return book
  - reissue book  


   When the user is not registred or the password or ID is wrong he will get the error message and login dialog would appear again. In case of user forget the password there will be a feature of forget password where user will proivide his registration email ID and new password will be send to his ID.  

- **search book:**  
The members can find any books by book name, Publisher's name, author name etc. by this feature of the LIS. After entering the valid search information in the search bar the LIS provide the list of all the books that member wants. One element of list should contain the following information:
  - Book title
  - Book cover image
  - Book author name
  - Book publisher name
  - Book description (in brief)
  - Availbility status
  - Location in shelf

- **Issue book:**   
The members of the LIS (studetns or professors) can issue the books if the following conditions met:
  - The book is available in the library (members can check this by **search book** features of the LIS)
  - The book availibility status must be the : available (No other member has currently issued the book)
  - Current user has not issued the maximum number of books 
if all the above conditions are met, the book is issued to the member.

   for the above conditione we need to set some parameter that is the maxumum numbers of books that memebers can issue. We will set the five for students and ten for professors. Once a book has been successfully issued, some updates will be made as describe below:
  - The member profile will update with new book issued
  - The book availibilty status will changed


- **Return book:**  
A book is issued for a defined period of time, we will set this as two week of time. In other words, the relevant member of LIS must return a book that has been issued within the next two weeks.  After returning the books some updates will be made as describe below:
  - The user account is updated to reflect the successful return of a book.
  - The book availibilty status will changed
 
 
- **Reissue book:**  
Any member who has issued a book might discover that his two week deadline has not enough. In that situation, he may decide to reissue the book and get permission to keep it for an additional two weeks. A member is only permitted to reissue any book a maximum of twice before having to return it. The user account is updated to reflect the new information once a book has been successfully reissued.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements: <br><br>

- **Performance:**  
  - The Up-time of the system shoud be above 99% (This system should remain accessible 24x7)
  - At least 75 users should be able to access the system altogether at any given time

- **Security :**  
  - This system should be accessible only within the institute LAN
  - The database of LIS should not store any password in plain text, the password must be stored in encrypted formate.

- **Design :**  
  - The LIS has to be developed as a web application with good UI and can be run on any available web browser
  - The system should be developed using HTML 5

- **Database**
- **Software Quality Attributes**
- **Reliability**
- **Reusability**
- **Scalability**



# Q.2. Identify FRs and NFRs:

<!-- **1. Functional Requirements:**   -->
### 1. Scope: 

The primary objective of the project is to provide an application for those who have hearing loss. Their daily needs for communication and safe travel will mostly benefit from it. This app would have a massive user base and receive government support because it will be for the benefit of society. They make up about 5% of the world's population. Being a real-time system and a medium for user and environment interaction, it will be a very effective solution.

### 2. Functional Requirements: <br><br>
- **user registration:**   
Any deaf can register in this app. The user would receive a user ID and password after successfully registering. For any upcoming uses of the app would require these credentials. 
- **User login:**  
An already registred user of this app can login to the system by the user ID and password (that he got while registering). On successful login the Home screen of the app is shown from where he can see all the facalities provided by the App.

   When the user is not registred or the password or ID is wrong he will get the error message and login dialog would appear again. In case of user forget the password there will be a feature of forget password where user will proivide his registration email ID and new password will be send to his ID.  
   
- **Sound Events:**   
By default the app will provide the following 8 sound events:
  - Alarm
  - Car Horn
  - Baby Crying
  - Dog
  - Door Knock
   - Doorbell
  - Gun
  - Emergency siren
 
 This means app can provide these number of classification. But user can choise any number of event (possibly all) for the future uses. When this event occusrs all the relevent information with images and full details will be shown to the user in the home screen.

- **Sound intensity:**  
Whne the event occurs the app will show the images with the sound intensity as well so the user can measure how the sound is large.

- **Phone Vibration:**  
- **Flash light:**  
Flash light will be turn on when the new event occurs so the deaf person can see the flashlight on event occcurs.
- **Notification:**  
App will be running in background so when any events occusr the user will notify by the notification. Notification contains the all brief information about the events so user don't need to open the app for the details of events.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements: <br><br>

- **Performance:**  
  - The Up-time of the system shoud be above 99% (This system should remain accessible 24x7)
  - As many as possible users should be able to access the system altogether at any given time

- **Security :**  
  - The database of app should not store any password in plain text, the password must be stored in encrypted formate.

- **Design :**  
  - The app desing shoud be clear to the end user so they can use it simply.

- **Database**
- **Software Quality Attributes**
- **Reliability**
- **Reusability**
- **Scalability**
